          The special variable IFS affects how splitting takes place when expanding unquoted variables. Don't
          set it globally. Prefer a dedicated utility such as 'cut' or 'awk' if you need to split input data.
          If you must use 'read', set IFS locally using e.g. 'IFS="," read -a my_array'.

          Avoid using `pickle`, which is known to lead to code execution vulnerabilities. When unpickling, the
          serialized data could be manipulated to run arbitrary code. Instead, consider serializing the       
          relevant data as JSON or a similar text-based serialization format.

          Detected the use of exec(). exec() can be dangerous if used to evaluate dynamic content. If this 
          content can be input from outside the program, this may be a code injection vulnerability. Ensure
          evaluated content is not definable by external sources.
